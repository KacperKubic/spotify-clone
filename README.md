<h1>SpotifyClone</h1>
<hr><p>Fully responsive Spotify Clone made with ReactJS, Redux and CSS. <br/>
It uses Spotify Web API to take all the user data from spotify such as: playlists, top listened songs etc. Spotify Web Player works only for premium users. <br/>
unfortunately I have to add all the users manually because spotify has not approved my app yet. Here is the test account I created for everyone to use: <br/>
